# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.


Part 1 (Image Classifier.html): Takes a dataset of flower images, creates an image classifier and predicts the name of the flower.

Part 2 (train.py & predict.py) : converts part 1 into an application which can be processed through a command line
